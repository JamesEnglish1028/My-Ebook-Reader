# Experiments And Archived Debug Assets

This folder contains non-production artifacts that are useful for investigation,
prototyping, and manual validation workflows.

- `e2e-notebooks/`: interactive notebook-based UI checks.
- `plyright-e2e/`: alternate notebook copies used for exploratory QA runs.
- `debug/`: captured request/response payloads and debug scripts from troubleshooting sessions.

Production code should not depend on files in this folder.
